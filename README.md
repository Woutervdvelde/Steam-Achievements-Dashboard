Steam Achievements Dashboard, aka SAD. A next.js app that can give you more insight in your steam achievements.

This is a project to develop react/next.js skills.  
  
It makes use of cookies, the only thing you need to fill in at start is your steamid.  
Making this way it allowed me to run this without an account system and having to hook up a database.  
(which also goes against the terms of use of the steam api key)

# Roadmap
As I'm writing this README the base has been completed, you can login and see your achievements.  
Allong the way I learned so much and that's why I'm already refactoring and improving my code for `V2.0`  
The UI is a part I'm not happy with so for `V2.1` I want to include [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
